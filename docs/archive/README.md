# Docs Archive

This folder stores historical documents that are kept for context but are not
part of the active operating guidance for this repository.

Guidelines:
- Do not treat archived files as current source-of-truth.
- Do not link archived files from runtime/operator workflows unless explicitly
  needed for historical reference.
- Prefer current top-level docs and in-repo skills for active procedures.
